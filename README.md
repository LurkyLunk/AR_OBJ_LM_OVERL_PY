## 1. Overview

The AR Overlay System combines object recognition capabilities with landmark detection to provide live annotations on a camera feed. Leveraging TensorFlow and Google Cloud Vision, our application ensures real-time and accurate identifications.

## 2. Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizing TensorFlow's MobileNetV2 for efficient recognition.
- **Landmark Recognition**: Powered by Google Cloud Vision API.
- **Information Overlay**: Wikipedia summaries for detected landmarks.
- **Simple GUI**: Powered by OpenCV for real-time video feed and annotations.

## 3. System Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A webcam or integrated camera

## 4. Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   ```
   git clone [repository link]
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Using pip, install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install opencv-python tensorflow google-cloud-vision wikipedia-api
   ```

3. **Configure Google Cloud Credentials**

   Set up your Google Cloud Vision API credentials and replace the placeholder in the script with the path to your `service_account_file.json`.

## 5. Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```
   python [your_script_name].py
   ```

2. Point the camera towards objects or landmarks.
3. Relevant labels and information will be overlaid on the detected items.

## 6. Contribution & Support

Contributions are welcome! For support, issues, or queries, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.
